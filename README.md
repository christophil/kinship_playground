train.py file contains the model architecture and can be use to train and get the final model.

Make sure you have trained model present in your directory.

The pdf file Kin_Dec.pdf conatins all the working code at one place.

# How to use

- flask run to launch server
- to train your own model, launch python train_O6.py ( do not forget to custom your model such as epoch number, final model file name etc in the last part of the code if needed ). The .h5 model will be generated ( needed in order to use upload route in the server ). Do not forget to check that the .h5 model name generated by train_06.py matches the .h5 model name used in app.py .

- XX_0X.py files are used to track code progress
- Python version 3.7.6, keras version 2.3.1, tensorflow version 1.14.0
